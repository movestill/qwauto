# QwAuto

Reduce the number of key strokes when updating transactions in Quicken.  I
wrote this because I got tired of the number of key presses and mouse clicks
required to switch an investment transaction from `Bought` to `BoughtX`.

With `QwAuto`, I can use `j` and `k` to get those `Bought` transactions and
press `Space` and `Enter` to convert them to `BoughtX` transactions with the
appropriate transfer account.
